`/echo`

This app demonstrates how to enter input from the command line and print it out in the dojo.


To run, start the app [from dojo], and then poke the app with any noun:

`|start %examples-echo`

`:examples-echo {insert any noun}`

Here the app simply printfs the input and then returns an empty list of moves and an identical context to the one it received.
