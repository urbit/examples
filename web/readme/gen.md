# Generators

Generators are short shell scripts.

Generators live under `/gen` in a `%clay` desk, and are invoked with `+name` at the `:dojo` prompt.

We've grouped generators by section, like `project-euler`. To run one you'll need the directory prefix:

    ~your-urbit:dojo> +project-euler/p1
    233.168

Note: Euler problems 5 and 14 take a little while to evaluate.
