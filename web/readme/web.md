# Web

Here you'll find the files for the example `%gall` applications that have a web frontend, as well as standalone `%ford` web examples that show how to use the Urbit build system to render data to the web.

Assuming you have these files inside a running urbit pier on an `%examples` desk by following the [examples readme](/~~/readme), and assuming you've already started each app (see the `app` readme), you can then access the `%gall` web UI's through your browser:    

    http://localhost:8443/~~/pages/{app}

where `{app}` is the app UI you're trying to view.

View the `%ford` web examples at:

    http://localhost:8443/~~/pages/ford/{n}

where `{n}` is the number of the example.
