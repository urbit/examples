# `:foos`

This app records foosball scores (one wins by scoring 10) into its state. It
then sends the updated state back to frontend, which then calculates and
displays the standings.

Run in `:dojo`:

```
> |start %foos
```

Then, in the browser:

```
http://localhost:8443/~~/pages/foos
```

Fill in a valid result (each name must be a string, each score must be between
0-10, and the winner must have 10). You can open another tab and watch the
standings remain in sync.

Let's walk through what happens when a valid result is submitted:

- `web/pages/foos/foos.js` catches the click event and checks that the data
is valid. If it is, `foos.js` uses `urb.send` to send JSON to your urbit.

- Our data is sent as the Hoon mark `json`, which is parsed by /mar/json.hoon

- Our parsed JSON is received by the `++poke-json` arm of
`app/foos.hoon`, which updates our state with the latest result and
then `spam`s the update all connected clients.
