# `:square`

This app prints out the square of an atom.

To run in `:dojo`:

```
> |start %square
```

Then:

```
> :square &atom 5
```

You should see:

`[%square 25]`

Here's what happened:

- the `square.hoon` app received our number

- The atom was parsed by `mar/atom.hoon`, and then passed to `++poke-atom`,
which printed out the square of the given number'.
