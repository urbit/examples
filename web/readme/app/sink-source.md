# `:sink` & `:source`

These two apps demonstrate how to set up a subscription from one app to another.

To run in `:dojo`:

```
> |start %sink

> |start %source
```

Then, turn the subscription on (note this is not a general syntax for starting
a subscription):

```
> :sink %on
```

Finally, submit some input to `sink` on the path where `sink` is
subscribed:

```
> :source {insert any noun}
```

You should see a printf from `sink.hoon` confirming it received the
subscription update.

Let's walk through what we did:

- when we poked `sink.hoon`, it received the noun `%on` with the `++poke-noun`
arm, setting our state to 'available'. `++poke-noun` then sends out a
subcription request to `source.hoon` on the path `/example-path`.

- `source.hoon` receives the subscription request with `++peer`. `%gall` then
sends confirmation to `++reap` in `sink.hoon`

- Then we poked `source.hoon` with a noun, which `source.hoon` parses with
`mar/noun.hoon`. `source.hoon` then receives this parsed data on its
`++poke-noun` arm.

- `++poke-noun` (in `source.hoon`) maps over the list of all clients subscribed
to the path `/example-path`, sending a `%diff %noun` to all of them.

- `sink.hoon` receives the update on the `++diff-noun`, and printfs the noun we
submitted.
