# `:echo`

This app demonstrates how to enter input from the command line and print it out
in the dojo.


To run, start the app from `:dojo`, and then poke the app with any noun:

`|start %echo`

`:echo {insert any noun}`

Here the app simply printfs the input and then returns an empty list of moves
and an identical context to the one it received.
